# Power Estimation toward Self-Reliance

- Daunting (seemingly complex and unavailable)
- Important (your success depends upon it)
- Error Prone (easy to mislead yourself)
- More available than commonly known (via simulation)

# What you will learn today

1. Power essentials
2. Why and how to compute power
3. Methods to simulate
4. Resources to make you even more self-reliant

# Housekeeping

- Install R
- Install Rstudio
- Install quarto

# Power really is....

P(p-value < p_{critical} | H_0 = False)

$$
\mbox{p-value} \equiv P(Result | H_0)
